class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        new = ListNode(0)
        new.next = head
        first = new
        second = new

        for _ in range(n + 1):
            first = first.next

        while first is not None:
            first = first.next
