# Code

```python3
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None
class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        if not head or not head.next:
            return False
        
        pointer1 = head
        pointer2 = head

        while pointer1.next and pointer1.next.next:
            pointer1 = pointer1.next.next
            pointer2 = pointer2.next

            if pointer1 == pointer2:
                return True

        return False
